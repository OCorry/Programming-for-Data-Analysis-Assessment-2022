    "In the health insurance industry in Ireland, amongst other principals, there is a principal known as <a href=\"https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health_system/private_health_insurance.html\" target=\"_top\">Community rating</a> which means that Health Insurers cannot increase/load an insurance premium based on variables such as age, health status etc. The recent introduction of <a href=\"https://www.hia.ie/consumer-information/lifetime-community-rating-explained\" target=\"_top\">Lifetime Community Rating</a> means however, that the insurance premium paid is dependant on the age at which the person takes out thier first Health Insurance policy.\n",

    "for the fourth quarter of the year 2021, the average cost of health insurance in Ireland for an individual audlt is â‚¬1,470.00 which works out at about US $\\$$1,523.14.\n",

    "Despite the introduction of Lifetime Community Rating in Ireland, there is still a stark contrast between the cost of health insurance premiums in Ireland versus the USA.

    "From a similar time period, **Figure 1.15** from the same report displays the increase in the cost of health insurance for family coverage relative to the increase in general inflation and more noteably, increase in workers earnings. While it is evident that there is an increase in workers earnings, the cost of family coverage health insurance is always increasing at a higher rate than that of workers earnings. "
