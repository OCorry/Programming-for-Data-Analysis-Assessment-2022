## Project Description:
***
The purpose of this project is to create a dataset by simulating a real-world phenomenon. Rather than collecting data, I will be modeling and synthasing data from a dataset, using Python and functions within Python. 

<br>

## Setup of Environment:
***
For this project, I firstly had to set up the relevant programming environment by installing relevant packages to my machine: 
- **Python (Anaconda)** - Installing the full Anaconda version of Python
- **Jupyter Notebooks** -on which Python was run
- **Visual Studio (VS) Code** - for doing my README.md write up
- **Cmdr** - to Navigate through directories and to open Jupyter notebook within the required Directory
    - As I am using a Windows machine, Cmdr is a more user friendly command line than the Windows Command Prompt 

<br>

In <a href="https://github.com/" target="_top">GitHub</a>, I set up my repository titled *Programming-For-Data-Analysis-2022* in my Github account and cloned my project repository to my machine using the ``git clone`` command in Cmdr. I left my repository public so that my work could be accessed publically. I made sure that my repository contained a README.md file. 
<p>
Once the repository was successfully cloned to my machine I opened Jupyter Notebook in the repository using the ``Jupyter Notebook`` command. This opens Jupyter Notebook as a local browser.
<p>
From here, I set up a new Jupyter Notebook titled *Programming for Data Analysis Project 2022.pynb* by clicking 'new' Python 3(ipykernel).
